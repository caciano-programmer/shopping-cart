# shopping-cart

This was made by following a tutorial from https://goo.gl/9Jv22c

This is a shopping cart made with node as the backend and on the front end a combination of
bootstrap and jquery, passport is used for authenticating users, and mongodb was used to store users, carts, sessions, etc.
Stripe was used as credit card processing.

please note that for this to work for you, you must create a stripe account 
and replace the current stripe keys with your own keys. Also you must install mongodb and specify a path to use, and
of course you must run npm install to install all of the node dependencies.

technologies used: node, mongodb, passport js, mongoose js, handlebars, bootstrap, bcrypt, etc.
